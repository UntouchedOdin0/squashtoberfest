> Details for the annual Magento+Adobe Squashtoberfest community initiative

## Squashtoberfest 2019

We are gearing up for Squashtoberfest 2019, and this year we want to include both Magento and Adobe repositories in the fun! In summary:

- To qualify, submit 5 or more pull requests during October 2019 to any open repositories
  under [github.com/adobe](https://github.com/adobe) or [github.com/magento](https://github.com/magento)
    - Please note that these pull requests should be of high quality! Adding
        punctuation, rewriting sentences in documentation, or other such similar
        patches that do not provide added value to the project will not be
        counted! It is always best to tackle _open issues_ in the project
        instead of sending a pull request without first having a conversation
        about a changeset with the project maintainers.
- At the end of the month we will crunch the numbers to see who qualified.
- We will get in touch with qualifying contributors to get their shirt sizes and
    then ship them cool swag!

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Where Can I Find Good Issues To Tackle?

For Magento repositories, the [Community Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/magento/projects/6)
is a great place to look for issues needing confirmation (Ready for QA column),
issues ready for development (Ready for Dev column) or good first issues.

For Adobe repositories, doing a [GitHub search for Good First Issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=org%3Aadobe+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&s=updated&type=Issues)
is a good place to look.

#### What Is The Best Way To Get Involved?

Once you've identified an issue you think you can help out with, comment on the
issue and mention you'd like to tackle it. Work with the project maintainers to
get the issue assigned to you.

#### How do I Send A Pull Request?

Each project is different. Your best bet is to read each project's contribution
guidelines - these are usually documented in the project repo as
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or sometimes it exists under `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`). Many
projects also have a pull request template enabled, so when you open a pull
request, you'll be presented with a checklist of things to prepare.

#### How Do I Know If I've Qualified?

In November, we will run an analysis on GitHub activity and identify folks who
have issued 5 or more pull requests to either Magento or Adobe repositories
during the month of October. We will file an issue in this repository,
mentioning the qualifying contributors by their handle and asking them to get in
touch with the Magento Community Engineering team to share t-shirt size and
shipping address with us.

Note that 

#### Where Can I Chat With Other Magento Community Members?

The best place is our Magento Community Engineering Slack! Join by clicking

#### Is This Event Related To Hacktoberfest?

We are doing essentially the same thing, in the same time frame, in a spirit of
solidarity and collaboration, but we are not officially related to
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
